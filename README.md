# DraculaBrackets

I like dark themes, and I am also really picky about what I have to stare at every day, for hours. This theme is much improved and refactored from Dracula of [Jacse's theme pack](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets).



## Before you begin

You need to install the "[Brackets UI Theming Enable](https://github.com/notasz/brackets-uitheming)" plugin to enjoy the full Dracula experience.

## Installation

Click the Lego brick icon in the right toolbar and search for "Dracula" in the Themes tab of Brackets.

Enjoy!
