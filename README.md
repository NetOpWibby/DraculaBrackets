# DraculaBrackets

I like dark themes, and I am also really picky about what I have to stare at every day, for hours. This theme is much improved and refactored from Dracula of [Jacse's theme pack](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets).

## Installation

I do not know how one gets a theme in Bracket's app store of whatever, but I know the manual way.

* `File > Extension Manager...`, or click the Lego brick icon in the right toolbar
* Click "Install from URL..." at the bottom of the modal
* Copy `https://github.com/NetOperatorWibby/DraculaBrackets`, paste to the input field and click "Install"
* Voila! You will find Dracula in `View > Themes...`
